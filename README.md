<h1>INDRA</h1>

Update 01 July 2020: This repository provides the code to generate your own variations on a seed file. For commercial purchase of projected files for simulation, based on climate model outputs, please email info@arbnco.com to request a quote.

This repository contains scripts to create synthetic weather time series from a short weather record of at least one year. This tool is named `indra` <sup>(1)</sup>. _All the scripts here should be treated as **experimental** unless explicitly stated otherwise._

<h2>Great, where do I begin?</h2>

<strong>Please, please see the <a href='https://github.com/paragrastogi/SyntheticWeather/wiki'>wiki</a> first.</strong> I can't make you do it though, so yes, be your own boss. The wiki contains a step-by-step guide to installing and running mighty <b>indra</b>.

If you know your way around MATLAB or Python, go directly into either the folder `m-files` (MATLAB files) or the folder `py-files` (Python files). Most of the scripts explain themselves. **Sample Python commands** are <a href='https://github.com/paragrastogi/SyntheticWeather/wiki/Sample-Commands'>given here</a>.

If you're interested in reading the methods used first, see the list of papers given below.

<h2>The methods</h2>

The MATLAB/R scripts are based on the algorithms published in Parag's thesis. While these scripts are well documented (in the two conference papers and thesis mentioned below), I won't be working on these any more. The Python scripts in the repository are translations of these original scripts. The method is an almost-completely-faithful translation of the MATLAB scripts<sup>(2)</sup>.

This work derives from my PhD thesis at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, EPFL (**Chapter 3**). The method is described in the following publications/references:

<h2>License, implementation, and compatibility</h2>

This tool is distributed under the GPLv3 license. Please read what this means <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License'>here</a>.

Using the older scripts requires only a valid MATLAB license and R (R is free to download and reuse). While you are free to use the scripts as you please, I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of using my scripts. Like if you accidentally release nuclear missiles, ruin the ski season in Switzerland, or cause a drought in Scotland.

Happy creating fake weather!


<h2>Footnotes</h2>

1. I haven't thought up a smarmy, contrived acronym yet but I'm working on it.

2. The difference lies in the 'simulation' of the SARMA model to produce synthetic 'de-mean-ed' series. I am not convinced that I should reproduce the 'custom noise' functionality used in the old scripts to simulate the SARMA models with bootstrapped residuals. For now, I am doing a 'conventional' simulation by using white noise.

2.Subsequent work and the Python translation was carried out when I was a visiting scientist at the Energy Systems Research Unit (ESRU), University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, and the RIKEN Institute for Advanced Intelligence Project (RIKEN-AIP), Tokyo. My stay at these institutions was financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under grant number p2elp2_168519.

I woud like to thank my hosts: Prof. Joe Clarke (Strathclyde, Glasgow) and Dr Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan and Prof. Masashi Sugiyama (RIKEN-AIP, Tokyo). The advice of Prof. Anthony Davison (EPFL, Lausanne) was crucial in creating the first models.
